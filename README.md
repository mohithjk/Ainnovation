# 🚀 Career Roadmap Recommendation Platform

## 1. Problem Statement
Engineering and technology students often struggle to find the right direction in their learning journey.  
- They are **unsure which career paths** to choose (Software Development, Cybersecurity, AI/ML, Cloud, etc.).  
- They spend **countless hours searching random YouTube videos or blogs** without any structured sequence.  
- They fail to build **industry-level projects and portfolios** that demonstrate practical skills.  
- As a result, their **employability is reduced** even after completing a degree.  

This gap between **academic learning** and **industry requirements** is one of the biggest challenges faced by students today.

## 2. Proposed Solution
We are building a **Personalized Career Roadmap Web Platform** that solves this problem by:  

1. **Structured Roadmaps**  
   - Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced level pathways for domains like **Web Development, Cybersecurity, AI, Cloud Computing**.  
   - Students always know what to learn next, instead of feeling lost.  

2. **Curated Resources**  
   - A library of **free resources** (videos, tutorials, courses, blogs).  
   - No more wasting time searching; everything is verified and relevant.  

3. **Project Suggestions**  
   - Students get **hands-on project ideas** at each stage.  
   - Example: Beginner (Portfolio Website) → Intermediate (To-Do App with React) → Advanced (Full-stack E-commerce app).  
   - This builds a **strong GitHub portfolio** that impresses recruiters.  

4. **Industry Insights**  
   - Explanations of real-world concepts (e.g., difference between **Black Hat vs White Hat hackers** in Cybersecurity).  
   - Students learn **how the industry works**, not just coding.  

5. **Personalized Recommendations**  
   - Based on student profile (interests + skills + career goals).  
   - Example: A student interested in **AI + Python** gets a different roadmap compared to someone interested in **Cloud + DevOps**.  

👉 In short:  
This website acts like a **career GPS for students**, guiding them step-by-step from beginner to job-ready.

## 3. Technical Architecture

### 🔹 Frontend  
- **React + Tailwind CSS** → For building a modern, responsive, and user-friendly UI.  
- Features: Login, Roadmap Viewer, Resource Dashboard, Progress Tracker.  

### 🔹 Backend  
- **Node.js + Express.js** → REST API to serve data to frontend.  
- Handles user profiles, roadmap logic, and recommendations.  

### 🔹 Database  
- **MongoDB via Azure Cosmos DB** → Stores:  
  - Roadmaps (structured learning paths)  
  - Projects (with tags for skill-level & tech stack)  
  - User profiles (progress, bookmarks, preferences)  

### 🔹 Authentication  
- **JWT-based secure login**  
- Allows users to:  
  - Save progress  
  - Bookmark resources  
  - Resume from where they left off  

### 🔹 Deployment  
- **Azure Web App Service**  
  - Frontend + Backend hosted on Azure for scalability.  

### 🔹 Monitoring & Logging  
- **Azure Application Insights** to track performance, errors, and usage metrics.  

### 🔹 CI/CD  
- **Azure DevOps pipeline** for automatic testing and deployment.

## 4. Usage of Microsoft Azure
We are leveraging multiple Azure services to make the platform **scalable, secure, and intelligent**:  

1. **Azure Web App Service** → Host both frontend and backend.  
2. **Azure Cosmos DB (MongoDB API)** → Store roadmaps, projects, and user data in a scalable NoSQL DB.  
3. **Azure Cognitive Services (optional)** → AI-driven personalized recommendations and insights.  
4. **Azure Application Insights** → Monitor app health, crashes, and user behavior.  
5. **Azure DevOps** → Continuous integration and deployment pipeline for faster updates.

## 5. Example User Journey
1. A student signs up and selects **“Interested in Cybersecurity” + “Beginner” level**.  
2. The platform generates a **Cybersecurity Roadmap**:  
   - Step 1: Basics of Networking → Free resource links.  
   - Step 2: Linux Fundamentals → Recommended course.  
   - Step 3: Cybersecurity Tools (Wireshark, Nmap) → Hands-on tutorials.  
   - Step 4: Build a Cybersecurity Lab Project.  

3. The student bookmarks a course, completes it, and tracks progress.  
4. The platform suggests a **real-world project** to add to their GitHub portfolio.  
5. Over time, the system adapts and recommends **advanced topics** as the student grows.
